                            关于Docker


  Docker是一个开源项目，它提供了一个在容器中部署软件应用环境的解决方案，它是一种操作系统层面的虚拟化抽象层.
Docker Hub是一个镜像的管理平台，可以存放和下载成型的镜像。https://hub.docker.com/



  Docker的框架是这样：

  


安装Docker

介绍一种在LINUX下安装docker的流程
》转换为根目录用户（或者在命令前添加sudo）
sudo sh -c su
》设置仓库
‣ $ apt-get update
‣ $ apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
‣ $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
‣ $ echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list &gt; /dev/null
‣ $ apt-get update


》安装docker engine
‣ $ apt-get update
‣ $ apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io


》验证是否成功（第一次可能要下载所需工具包）
docker run hello-world

若成功，可以看到“hello from docker！”字样。

常用Docker命令

》pull 用于从远程拉取docker images，例如
docker pull busybox

》查看docker images清单
docker images


》运行一个容器
docker run busybox echo "hello from busybox"

在使用run命令时，docker客户端实际上在执行：1.找到镜像（busybox）2.加载容器3.在容器中运行指令
》查看在运行的容器
docker ps

或查看更多信息
docker ps -a

》移除容器，可使用名称，id等
docker rm 305297d7a235 ff0a5c3750b9


清理存在的容器
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)

-q只返回id，-f添加一个过滤器
停止一个容器
docker stop name

》移除未使用的镜像
docker rmi hello-world

示例运行一个静态网站

拉取一个网站镜像，并在后台运行这个容器
docker run -d -P --name static-site prakhar1989/static-site

其中-d是在后台运行，我们的终端继续运行；-p是publish所有端口到随机端口；–name我的起的网站名字
运行docker port 【container】可以查看端口映射

也可以定制一个端口映射关系（将容器外的8888端口映射到容器内的80端口）
docker run -p 8888:80 prakhar1989/static-site

创建一个我们自己的镜像

部署一个Flask app
‣ $ git clone https://github.com/prakhar1989/docker-curriculum
‣ $ cd docker-curriculum/flask-app
‣ $ cat Dockerfile

Dockerfile是一个文本文档，它包含了当docker客户端想要创建一个镜像时所需要的一系列命令


使用docker build来依据docker file创建一个docker镜像
docker build -t &lt;用户名&gt;/catnip .

其中指的你在docker hub上的用户名。创建完成后可以docker images看一下，然后运行容器
docker run -p 8888:5000 &lt;用户名&gt;/catnip

此时用浏览器登录可以看到静态网站了。


将自己的镜像上传至docker hub
》登陆，输入账户信息。
docker login

》推送镜像。
docker push &lt;用户名&gt;/catnip

》现在任何安装了docker的人可以运行你的镜像了，只需要一行命令
docker run -p 8888:5000 &lt;用户名&gt;/catnip

                            This section deals with the step-by-step process of how to write and publish posts on your site.

Make _pages directory

Create a directory named _pages in root if you do not have it.

$ mkdir _pages
$ cd _pages


Organize your directory structure

Our theme provides a hierarchical directory structure. You may create subdirectories (let’s say Category A) in _pages, and then all post entities placed in the Category A directory will be categorized as such.

._pages
├── Category A
├── Category B
|   ├── Subcatecory b
|   ├── Subcatecory c


Note: Make sure all directories have an index.md inside of them.

The next step is, placing index.md files in both _pages directory and its subdirectories. The inner content of each index.md should be just two dashed lines as shown below:

---
---


Or you can type the following command from each directory.

$ echo -e "---\n---" &gt; index.md


Your _pages structure now looks like this:

._pages
└── index.md
├── Category A
|   └── index.md
├── Category B
|   └── index.md
|   ├── Subcatecory b
|       └── index.md
|   ├── Subcatecory c
|       └── index.md


Write a blog post


Create a post with file extension: .md (ex., Post-name.md).

All blog post files must begin with front matter typically used to set a title or other metadata.

Note that the title and date fields can’t be left blank.

For a simple example:

---
title: "Example Post"
date: "2023-12-01"
---

# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

I hope you like it!


Setting a Post Thumbnail Image

Add thumbnail attribute to the post that you’d like to show a representative image when rendered.

---
title: "Example Post: thumbnail exists"
date: "2023-12-02"
thumbnail: "/assets/img/thumbnail/bricks.webp"
---




Category Tag

You can use a grouping of post topics by specifying the tags field. It is helpful when you’d like to search related posts or pin them on the bottom of the page.

---
title: "Classic Literature #1: Romeo and Juliet"
tags:
    - book
    - epic novel
    - romance
date: "2023-12-04"
thumbnail: "/assets/img/thumbnail/nightgardenflower.jpg"
---




Note that the tags attribute won’t be reflected to the sidebar navigation.

Bookmark

Setting bookmark: true makes the sidebar nav list display the corresponding post entity.

---
title: "Markdown from A to Z"
tags:
    - user manual
    - markdown
    - writing format
date: "2023-09-05"
thumbnail: "https://i.ibb.co/MRzw6T9/sample.webp"
bookmark: true
---




Example _pages structure


Here is the structure introduced in our repo:

._pages

|   └── index.md
|   ├── Subcatecory a
|       └── index.md
|       └── post-01.md
|       └── post-02.md
├── Category B
|   └── index.md
|   ├── Subcatecory b    
|       └── index.md
|       └── post-03.md
|       ├── Subsubcategory 1
|           └── index.md
|           └── post-04.md
|       ├── Subsubcategory 2
|           └── index.md
|           └── post-05.md
|   ├── Subcatecory c
|       └── index.md

Chapter I.

In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject), although from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana. This, however, is of but little importance to our tale; it will be enough not to stray a hair’s breadth from the truth in the telling of it.

You must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at leisure (which was mostly all the year round) gave himself up to reading books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirely neglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of his property; and to such a pitch did his eagerness and infatuation go that he sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read, and brought home as many of them as he could get. But of all there were none he liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva’s composition, for their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in his sight, particularly when in his reading he came upon courtships and cartels, where he often found passages like “the reason of the unreason with which my reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at your beauty;” or again, “the high heavens, that of your divinity divinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert your greatness deserves.” Over conceits of this sort the poor gentleman lost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand them and worm the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not have made out or extracted had he come to life again for that special purpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis gave and took, because it seemed to him that, great as were the surgeons who had cured him, he must have had his face and body covered all over with seams and scars. He commended, however, the author’s way of ending his book with the promise of that interminable adventure, and many a time was he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly as is there proposed, which no doubt he would have done, and made a successful piece of work of it too, had not greater and more absorbing thoughts prevented him.

Many an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learned man, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which had been the better knight, Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the village barber, however, used to say that neither of them came up to the Knight of Phoebus, and that if there was any that could compare with him it was Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had a spirit that was equal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight, nor lachrymose like his brother, while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind him. In short, he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark, poring over them; and what with little sleep and much reading his brains got so dry that he lost his wits. His fancy grew full of what he used to read about in his books, enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves, agonies, and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read of was true, that to him no history in the world had more reality in it. He used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz was a very good knight, but that he was not to be compared with the Knight of the Burning Sword who with one back-stroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants. He thought more of Bernardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments, availing himself of the artifice of Hercules when he strangled Antaeus the son of Terra in his arms. He approved highly of the giant Morgante, because, although of the giant breed which is always arrogant and ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But above all he admired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he saw him sallying forth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when beyond the seas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history says, was entirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of a Ganelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into the bargain.

In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion that ever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he fancied it was right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour as for the service of his country, that he should make a knight-errant of himself, roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in quest of adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had read of as being the usual practices of knights-errant; righting every kind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in the issue, he was to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself crowned by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so, led away by the intense enjoyment he found in these pleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith to put his scheme into execution.

The first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to his great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished it as best he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that it had no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency, however, his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one. It is true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew his sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. The ease with which he had knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that danger he set to work again, fixing bars of iron on the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, not caring to try any more experiments with it, he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most perfect construction.

He next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a real and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that “tantum pellis et ossa fuit,” surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the Babieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name to give him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse belonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own, should be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a new character, he should take a new name, and that it should be a distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling he was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struck out, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to his thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks in the world.

Having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to get one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this point, till at last he made up his mind to call himself “Don Quixote,” whence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious history have inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, and not Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that the valiant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it famous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to add on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote of La Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described accurately his origin and country, and did honour to it in taking his surname from it.

So then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his hack christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to the conclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love with; for a knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul. As he said to himself, “If, for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant, and overthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him, will it not be well to have some one I may send him to as a present, that he may come in and fall on his knees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, ‘I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania, vanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to present myself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure’?” Oh, how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especially when he had thought of some one to call his Lady! There was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very good-looking farm-girl with whom he had been at one time in love, though, so far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name was Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of Lady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which should not be out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that of a princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del Tobosoâ€”she being of El Tobosoâ€”a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon, and significant, like all those he had already bestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him.

  Author: William Shakespeare
  Country: England
  Genre: Shakespearean tragedy
  Publication date:	1597


Synopsis

The prologue of Romeo and Juliet calls the title characters “star-crossed lovers”—and the stars do seem to conspire against these young lovers.

Romeo is a Montague, and Juliet a Capulet. Their families are enmeshed in a feud, but the moment they meet—when Romeo and his friends attend a party at Juliet’s house in disguise—the two fall in love and quickly decide that they want to be married.

A friar secretly marries them, hoping to end the feud. Romeo and his companions almost immediately encounter Juliet’s cousin Tybalt, who challenges Romeo. When Romeo refuses to fight, Romeo’s friend Mercutio accepts the challenge and is killed. Romeo then kills Tybalt and is banished. He spends that night with Juliet and then leaves for Mantua.

Juliet’s father forces her into a marriage with Count Paris. To avoid this marriage, Juliet takes a potion, given her by the friar, that makes her appear dead. The friar will send Romeo word to be at her family tomb when she awakes. The plan goes awry, and Romeo learns instead that she is dead. In the tomb, Romeo kills himself. Juliet wakes, sees his body, and commits suicide. Their deaths appear finally to end the feud.

                            What is Lorem Ipsum?

This is an example post ‘&lt;’. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Why do we use it?

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

Where does it come from?

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

Where can I get some?

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

                            Headings


To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (&lt;h3&gt;), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).


  
    
      Markdown
      HTML
      Rendered Output
    
  
  
    
      # Header 1
      &lt;h1&gt;Header 1&lt;/h1&gt;
      Header 1
    
    
      ## Header 2
      &lt;h2&gt;Header 2&lt;/h2&gt;
      Header 2
    
    
      ### Header 3
      &lt;h3&gt;Header 3&lt;/h3&gt;
      Header 3
    
  


Emphasis

You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks (e.g., **text** = text) or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

Italic
To italicize text, add one asterisk (e.g., *text* = text) or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

Blockquotes
To create a blockquote, add a &gt; in front of a paragraph.

Lists
You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

Ordered Lists
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item



  First item
  Second item
  Third item
  Fourth item


Unordered Lists
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item



  First item
  Second item
  Third item
  Fourth item


Code
To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).


  
    
      Markdown
      HTML
      Rendered Output
    
  
  
    
      At the command prompt, type `nano`.
      At the command prompt, type &lt;code&gt;nano&lt;/code&gt;.
      At the command prompt, type nano.
    
  


Escaping Backticks
If the word or phrase you want to denote as code includes one or more backticks, you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double backticks (``).


  
    
      Markdown
      HTML
      Rendered Output
    
  
  
    
      ``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``
      &lt;code&gt;Use `code` in your Markdown file.&lt;/code&gt;
      Use `code` in your Markdown file.
    
  


Code Blocks
To create code blocks that spans multiple lines of code, set the text inside three or more backquotes ( ``` ) or tildes ( ~~~ ).

&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


def foo():
  a = 1
  for i in [1,2,3]:
    a += i


Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.

_________________


Links
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Blue Archive]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://bluearchive.nexon.com)).

My favorite mobile game is [Blue Archive](https://bluearchive.nexon.com).


The rendered output looks like this:

My favorite mobile game is Blue Archive.

Adding Titles

You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in quotation marks after the URL.

My favorite mobile game is [Blue Archive](https://bluearchive.nexon.com "All senseis are welcome!").


The rendered output looks like this:

My favorite mobile game is Blue Archive.

URLs and Email Addresses
To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

&lt;https://www.youtube.com/&gt;
&lt;fake@example.com&gt;


The rendered output looks like this:
https://www.youtube.com/
fake@example.com

Images
To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL.

![Tropical Paradise](/assets/img/example.jpg "Maldives, in October")


The rendered output looks like this: 

Linking Images
To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.

[![La Mancha](/assets/img/La-Mancha.jpg "La Mancha: Spain, Don Quixote")](https://www.britannica.com/place/La-Mancha)


The rendered output looks like this: 

Escaping Characters
To display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text in a Markdown document, add a backslash (\) in front of the character.

\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.


The rendered output looks like this:

* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.

Characters You Can Escape
You can use a backslash to escape the following characters.


  
    
      Character
      Name
    
  
  
    
      `
      backtick

HTML
Many Markdown applications allow you to use HTML tags in Markdown-formatted text. This is helpful if you prefer certain HTML tags to Markdown syntax. For example, some people find it easier to use HTML tags for images. Using HTML is also helpful when you need to change the attributes of an element, like specifying the color of text or changing the width of an image.

To use HTML, place the tags in the text of your Markdown-formatted file.

This **word** is bold. This &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; is italic.


The rendered output looks like this:

This word is bold. This word is italic.
